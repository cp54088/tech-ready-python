# Toms River Tech Ready Python

Our game is called Bounce. It is really similar to the game "Pong". We used resources online to help us make our code. We manuipulated the code to suit our vision for our game better. To play the game, you have to try and make sure you catch the ball with your paddle. If it falls past your paddle, you lose. We made an easy and hard version by changing different variables such as speed, ball size, and paddle size.
